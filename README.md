# targets-test
Project to practise all targets package set of functions

## 1. Create single scripts for each analysis steps
- In this example I have started creating one script to load the data and another one to create a plot from that data

## 2. Turn these single scripts into functions
There is a folder called "before targets" containing individual R scripts called "code_pre_targets.R" this script allows me to plan the analysis.
The second script "scripts_into_functions_targets_prep.R" contains new **functions** based on initial scripts to wwork with Targets package

## 3. Functions used by Targets saved in R folder
