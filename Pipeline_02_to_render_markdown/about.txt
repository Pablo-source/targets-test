The Aim of this pipeline will be to render a Markdown report inside the Targets pipeline. 

Main difference with previous pipeline is that I will render the final report in the pipeline, also populating some sections with objects created by Targets

I will focus on A&E Attendances data in this new pipeline. Splitting initial “Monthly-AE-Time-Series-March-2024.xls” file into  individual Attendances type (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3). csv files. I will cleanse them and turn date fields into formatted standard R dates. 
Then I will merge them and create an adhoc report. Rendering this report within the Targets pipeline.
