*Pipeline_02_to_render_markdown*

I will focus on A&E Attendances data in this new pipeline. Splitting initial “Monthly-AE-Time-Series-March-2024.xls” file into  individual Attendances type (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3). csv files. I will cleanse them and turn date fields into formatted standard R dates. 

Then I will merge them and create an adhoc report. Rendering this report within the Targets pipeline.
