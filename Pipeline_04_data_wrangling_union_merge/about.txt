This pipeline describes common merge and union data manipulation steps inside a Targets pipeline, based on a set of .csv input files:

- AE_TYPE_I_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2010.csv
- AE_TYPE_I_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2011_2020.csv
- AE_TYPE_I_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2021_2024.csv
- AE_TYPE_2_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2010.csv
- AE_TYPE_2_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2011_2020.csv
- AE_TYPE_2_ATT_AUG10_JAN24_2021_2024.csv


The pipeline I have design covers the following set of steps:

- Read in data from "data" sub-folder in the pipeline where all input files are stored
1. Data ingestion (read in .csv files into the pipeline)
2. Clean files
3. Union files
4. Merge unioned files
5. Output unioned files as a new .csv file called "Attendances_I_II_merged.csv" and saved it in the "objects" folder
